{"name":"forecast","tagline":"Weather forecast query tool for the command line","body":"forecast is a query program for the [forecast.io](https://forecast.io)\r\nAPI. It provides a command line interface which makes weather data for a\r\nconfigurable location available in the terminal.\r\n\r\nCapabilities include:\r\n\r\n* Plotting tables with current, hourly and daily weather conditions\r\n* Rendering barplots of temperature and precepitation curves for hourly\r\n  and daily weather forecasts, sunrise and sunset times for daily\r\n  weather forecasts and many more things\r\n* Dumping of the original JSON weather data\r\n\r\n## Current project status\r\n\r\nThe last stable release is `0.5.0`. Development is active. Currently, a\r\npartial rewrite is underway which will use a tree data structure (see\r\n`tree.c`) as the central data store.\r\n\r\nThis rewrite will simplify much of the messy code in `render.c` and\r\nenable the implementation of several new and improved features. One of\r\nthese will be **forecastfs**, a FUSE-based virtual file system for\r\npresenting weather data to any file-aware program. After finishing\r\nforecastfs, the ncurses UI will receive more love and features.\r\n\r\n## Dependencies\r\n\r\n* [libjson-c](https://github.com/json-c/json-c) is used for retrieving\r\n  the weather data.\r\n* [libconfig](http://www.hyperrealm.com/libconfig/) is used for\r\n  configuration file management.\r\n* [libcurl](http://curl.haxx.se/libcurl/) (built with SSL support) is\r\n  used for interacting with the forecast.io API.\r\n* [libncursesw5](https://www.gnu.org/software/ncurses) drives the\r\n  terminal UI.\r\n* [libcrypto](https://www.openssl.org/docs/manmaster/crypto/crypto.html)\r\n  (part of OpenSSL) is used as a source for hash algorithms. Suggestions\r\n  for more lightweight alternatives are welcome.\r\n* [liblz4](https://github.com/Cyan4973/lz4) is used for compressing the\r\n  on-disk cache files.\r\n* [libtalloc](https://talloc.samba.org/talloc/doc/html/index.html) is\r\n  the future of forecast's memory management.\r\n\r\nThe build system uses GNU autoconf and automake.\r\n\r\n## Build\r\n\r\n### Generic Linux/Unix system\r\n\r\nAfter installing all dependencies, this will configure and build the\r\nprogram:\r\n\r\n```sh\r\n./autogen.sh\r\n./configure --prefix=/your/prefix\r\nmake\r\nmake install\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Debian and Ubuntu\r\n\r\nforecast is available as\r\n[`forecast`](http://pkg.bunsenlabs.org/debian/pool/main/f/forecast/)\r\nthrough the BunsenLabs project's Debian repository at\r\n[pkg.bunsenlabs.org](http://pkg.bunsenlabs.org/repoidx.html#forecast).\r\n\r\n\r\n### Arch Linux\r\n\r\nforecast is available through the AUR as\r\n[`forecast-git`](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/forecast-git/).\r\n\r\n## Synopsis\r\n\r\n```\r\nUsage:\r\n  forecast [dehL:l:m:rs:u:v] [LONGFORM OPTIONS]\r\nOptions:\r\n  -d|--dump                      Dump the JSON data and a newline to stdout\r\n  -e|--extend-hourly             Request data for one week instead of two days\r\n                                 for hourly forecasts.\r\n  -h|--help                      Print this message and exit\r\n  -L|--location-by-name   NAME   Select a location predefined in the configuration file\r\n  -l|--location           CHOORD Query the weather at this location; CHOORD is a string in the format\r\n                                 <latitude>:<longitude> where the choordinates are given as floating\r\n                                 point numbers\r\n  --language              NAME   Set the language for verbal descriptions.\r\n  -m|--mode               MODE   One of print, print-hourly, plot-hourly, plot-daily, plot-precip-daily,\r\n                                 plot-precip-hourly, plot-daylight. Defaults to 'print'\r\n  -r|--request                   By pass the cache if a cache file exists\r\n  -s|--step               N      In hourly plots, use only every Nth datapoint.\r\n  -u|--units              UNITS  Location-specific unit table to be used. One of si, us, uk, ca, auto.\r\n                                 When specifying 'auto', the unit will be set depending on location\r\n  -v|--version                   Print program version and exit\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhen using --location, the cache will be bypassed in any case. In\r\nplotting mode, the plot will be shown until you press a key.\r\n\r\n## API key\r\n\r\nIn order to use the API, you need to obtain an API key from forecast.io.\r\nYou are able to make 1000 API calls per day free of charge. The\r\nregistration interface is [here](https://developer.forecast.io/).\r\n\r\n## Configuration file\r\n\r\nforecast uses a configuration file in libconfig format. The file is by\r\ndefault located at\r\n```sh\r\n$HOME/.forecastrc\r\n```\r\nbut you may override the location by setting the *FORECAST_CONFIG_PATH*\r\nenvironment variable. If available, command line parameters take\r\nprecedence over the config file settings.\r\n\r\nThe best way to create the config file is to copy and edit the provided\r\nforecastrc.example.\r\n\r\nAs for the meaning of the keys, read the comments in forecastrc.example\r\nfile which is part of the forecast distribution. When forecast is\r\nalready installed on your system, the documentation files are located in\r\n/usr/share/doc/forecast.\r\n\r\n## How it looks (or can look) like\r\n\r\nIRL demo pic with a sweet orange glow:\r\n\r\n[![philipsmonochrome_by_jaseg.th.jpg](https://cdn.scrot.moe/images/2015/12/30/philipsmonochrome_by_jaseg.th.jpg)](https://scrot.moe/image/aTf8)\r\n\r\nDaily overlay forecast plot (-m plot-daily), with the label format\r\n\"%d%b\", showing the min/max temperatures on each day:\r\n\r\n[![ex4.md.png](https://cdn.scrot.moe/images/2015/12/30/ex4.th.png)](https://scrot.moe/image/aRzq)\r\n\r\nHourly forecast plot (-m plot-hourly), with the label format \"%H:%M\":\r\n\r\n[![ex3.md.png](https://cdn.scrot.moe/images/2015/12/30/ex3.th.png)](https://scrot.moe/image/adoy)\r\n\r\n## License\r\n\r\n```\r\nThis program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify\r\nit under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by\r\nthe Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or\r\n(at your option) any later version.\r\n\r\nThis program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\r\nbut WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\r\nMERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.
